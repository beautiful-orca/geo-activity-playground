# Heatmaps

A heatmap shows where you have been more often than other places. There is an interactive and zoomable heatmap that looks like this:

Here you can see where I mostly travel between Bonn and Cologne.

You have the option to download a rendered heatmap from the current viewport of the interactive map, there is a link below the map. That rendering is based on the [Strava local heatmap code](https://github.com/remisalmon/Strava-local-heatmap). Depending on the zoom level it might look more nuanced regarding the colors or show gaps between the points as they are not interpolated as with the interactive heatmap.
