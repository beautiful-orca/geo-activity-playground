# Heatmaps

A heatmap shows where you have been more often than other places. There is an interactive and zoomable heatmap that looks like this:

Here you can see where I mostly travel between Bonn and Cologne.

You have the option to download a rendered heatmap from the current viewport of the interactive map as in image with up to 4000Ã—4000 pixels, there is a link below the map.
