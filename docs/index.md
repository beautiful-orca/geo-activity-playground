# Home

I like to be outside and I like to record my outdoor activities with a GPX tracker. So far I have kept all my data with [Strava](https://strava.com/) and did some analyses there and also with [Statshunters](https://statshunters.com/). This is already pretty nice.

There are some things which they don't offer, so I want to have a place to implement them. Also I want to support the option of using only local data. This makes this project attractive for people who have a stash of GPX or FIT files but no nice way to analyze their data.

The goal of this project is to import data either from local GPX/FIT files or the Strava API and provide some interesting insights into the data.

You can [find the code on GitHub](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground) where you can also file issues. If you would like to use this yourself or contribute, feel free to reach out via the contact options [from my website](https://martin-ueding.de/). I would especially appreciate improvements to the documentation. If you're familiar with Markdown and GitHub, you can also directly create a pull request.

This project is still in a early prototyping phase, I'm still changing a lot and some fundamental decisions are still not finally settled. So please keep in mind that it is all pretty brittle.

## Get started

Install the software using one of the following options:

- [Using the stable version on Linux](getting-started/installing-stable-on-linux.md)
- [Using the stable version on Windows](getting-started/installing-stable-on-windows.md)
- [Using the development version on Linux](getting-started/installing-git-on-linux.md)

Get your activity data in place using one of the following options:

- [Use local activity files](getting-started/using-activity-files.md) if you already have these.
- [Use the Strava API](getting-started/using-strava-api.md) if you want to use this project to analyse your data on Strava.
- [Move from Strava](getting-started/moving-from-strava.md) if you wan to leave Strava and work locally from then on.
